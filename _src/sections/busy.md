I’ve been a speaker at conferences like [An Event Apart](https://aneventapart.com/) and [Smashing Conference](https://smashingconf.com), and an emcee for [Confab](https://www.confabevents.com). I’m an amateur boxer, [aspiring chef](https://wiltomakesfood.com), halfway decent carpenter, passable antique British motorcycle mechanic, and wannabe gardener.

I’ve even been in a movie—_[What Comes Next is the Future](http://www.futureisnext.com/)_—to discuss the role I played in web standards, and how I hoped to change them. I’ve got an [IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8414808/) and everything!

Just—… just ignore the other thing on there.

It’s a long story.
