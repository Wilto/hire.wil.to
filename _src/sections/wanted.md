Me, I’m stubborn. If it can be done on the web, I believe that it can be done responsively, it can be done accessibly, and it can be done in a performant way—it can be made to work for everyone. 

The trickier that might seem at first, the more you’ve got my attention.

Those are the kind of projects I’m interested in—not _just_ because that’s the sort of impact I want to make on the web, but because that’s where the _exciting_ work is. That’s the space where we get to invent new approaches and techniques; to build something brand new together, in pursuit of making the web a faster, more welcoming, and more inclusive place.

If it sounds as though I might be a good fit for your next project, [don’t hesitate to get in touch](mailto:mat@matmarquis.com). I’m looking forward to it.
