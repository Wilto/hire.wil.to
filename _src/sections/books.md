  ### Books
[JavaScript for Web Designers](https://abookapart.com/products/javascript-for-web-designers) is intended for anyone taking their first steps into the world of JavaScript development—it’s out-of-print now, so I put [the whole thing up on the web](https://javascriptforwebdesigners.com/). [Image Performance](https://abookapart.com/products/image-performance) covers everything from image formats and compression methods, to responsive image markup, to automation.

### Courses

I’ve authored two courses for [web.dev](https://web.dev), Google’s official source for guidance around building fast and functional websites: [Learn Images](https://web.dev/learn/images) and [Learn JavaScript](https://web.dev/learn/javascript).

#### Coming soon!
I’m currently working with [Picalilli](https://piccalil.li) on a JavaScript course paced for both aspiring and adept JavaScript developers, and in-depth enough for anyone looking to dig deeper into JavaScript’s seemingly-arcane inner workings. Head over to [Piccalil.li and sign up for updates](https://piccalil.li/javascript-for-everyone#sign-up) to stay in the loop!
