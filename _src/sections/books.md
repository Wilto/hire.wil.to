[JavaScript for Web Designers](https://abookapart.com/products/javascript-for-web-designers) is paced for anyone taking their first steps into the world of JavaScript development, but in-depth enough for anyone looking to understand JavaScript’s inner workings. [Image Performance](https://abookapart.com/products/image-performance) is a guide to a subject that’s easy to take for granted, but difficult to master: putting images on the web. It covers everything from image formats and compression methods, to responsive image markup, to automation. Before writing any books of my own, I wrote the _Robust, Responsible, Responsive Web Design_ chapter of [Smashing Book 4](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-4-new-perspectives/), and two chapters on JavaScript for the fourth edition of Jennifer Robbins’ _[Learning Web Design](https://www.learningwebdesign.com/)_.

I was also invited to develop two in-depth courses for [web.dev](https://web.dev), the Google Chrome team’s official guidance around building fast and functional websites: [Learn Images](https://web.dev/learn/images) and [Learn JavaScript](https://web.dev/learn/javascript).

And listen: if there are any [cookbook](https://wiltomakesfood.com) publishers are out there reading this, well, I’d hear you out.
