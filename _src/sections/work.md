  I’m a developer that heavily skews “designer.” From design to implementation, I believe that a good layout is a flexible, durable, and maintainable one.

  I’ve been brought in to help clients like [Rolling Stone](https://rollingstone.com) with their performance concerns, clients like [Axios](https://axios.com) and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mwf) with their accessibility concerns, and clients like [ProPublica](https://propublica.org/) and [Amazon’s PillPack](https://www.pillpack.com/) to build, maintain, and improve on their websites.

  ### Responsive Web Design

  I’m incredibly fortunate to have played a small part in the history of Responsive Web Design, from the earliest discussions of the responsive [Boston Globe](https://bostonglobe.com) project—all the way back in 2011—to leading the effort to add responsive image features to the [HTML specification](https://www.w3.org/community/respimg/), [browsers](https://alistapart.com/blog/post/bringing-responsive-images-to-browsers), and [major CMSes](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/responsive-images-merge-proposal/).

  ### Front-End Performance

  I’ve had the privilege of traveling the world speaking about front-end performance. I’ve worked with organizations large and small not just to audit, identify, and help fix their performance pain points, but to establish workflows, development habits, and support systems that allow those improvements—and their results—to persist long after I’m gone.

  ### Accessibility

  I firmly believe that accessibility isn’t an add-on, a line item, or an ticket languishing in an issue tracker for “if we have time at the end.” It’s a persistent consideration through every step in the creation of a site—from content, to wireframes, to markup, to the final product. In the years that followed my accessibility work on the [jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile teams](https://jquery.org/team/), I’ve helped guide a number of organizations through the process of prioritizing accessibility both technically _and_ culturally.
