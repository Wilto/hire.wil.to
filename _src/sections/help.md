If you’re here to help people, I’m here to help you.

I’m immensely proud to have volunteered time to organizations like [Blaseball Cares](https://www.blaseballcares.com) (let’s grow, Flowers) and [The Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/)—groups working to make a real difference in peoples’ lives. 

If your organization is working to help those in vulnerable positions and you think my areas of expertise could help you do just that, [let’s talk](mailto:mat@matmarquis.com). 

Whether it’s an on-the-fly accessibility audit, tips for speeding up your website, a second opinion on a particularly thorny browser issue, or _any_ advice about the web, how it’s built, and how to hire the people that build it: your non-profit is welcome to [book some “Office Hours” time on my calendar](https://calendly.com/mat-marquis/office-hours), completely free of charge, whenever it’s convenient for you and your team.
