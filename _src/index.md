My goal is to ensure that your content can reach any user, in any browsing context—regardless of the size of their screen, the speed of their internet connection, the age of their device, or the combination of browsers and assistive technologies they use to experience the web.

If you have the same goal, [we should chat](mailto:mat@matmarquis.com).
